Advanced Usage
==============

This section collects tips for power users and administrators.

* **Multi-edit chains**: when updating a status message multiple times in a
  row (for progress bars, animations, etc.) insert brief sleeps between edits
  to avoid WhatsApp rate limits.  ``await asyncio.sleep(0.5)`` is typical.

* **Flood waits**: sending many messages in a short time may trigger WhatsApp's
  anti-spam.  Respect pauses, limit counts, and catch ``FloodWait`` exceptions
  if using a lower-level client.

* **Running 24/7**: deploy on a server with a process supervisor (systemd,
  supervisord).  Persist the session file generated by the WhatsApp client.

* **Docker deployment**: mount a volume for the session and configuration.

* **Logging**: set ``LOGLEVEL=DEBUG`` for troubleshooting; redirect stdout
  to a log file with ``python bot.py 2>&1 | tee bot.log``.

* **High-traffic**: use a small VM, avoid heavy computations in plugins, and
  keep the event loop running by using ``asyncio`` instead of blocking calls.

* **Backup**: copy the SQLite database file periodically, or configure a
  remote MongoDB instance by setting ``MONGO_URI``.

The codebase is not designed for thousands of concurrent messages; it is
intended for personal use or small groups.  Heavy automation may result in
account bans from WhatsApp.
