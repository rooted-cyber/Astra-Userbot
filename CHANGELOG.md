## [0.0.2b15] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- **Performance**: Replaced synchronous `time.sleep` with `asyncio.sleep` in several core methods (`Message.edit`, `ChatMethods.edit_message`). This fixes the "Cannot edit message" error (E3006) by ensuring the event loop is never blocked during message acknowledgement.
- **Reliability**: Updated `.ping` command to use `waitForSend=True`, ensuring the base message is fully acknowledged by WhatsApp before the second result-edit is attempted.

## [0.0.2b14] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- **Performance**: Replaced synchronous `time.sleep` with `asyncio.sleep` in several core methods (Pre-release candidate).

## [0.0.2b13] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- **Logging Supremacy**: Suppressed noisy `PROTOCOL` and internal bridge logs by moving them to the `DEBUG` level. This ensures the console remains clean for production use while maintaining detailed diagnostics in debug mode.

## [0.0.2b12] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- **Pairing UX**: Increased the phone pairing retry interval from 10s to 60s to give users ample time to input the code.
- **Log Noise Reduction**: Reduced internal bridge protocol logs from INFO to DEBUG level to provide a cleaner console experience.

## [0.0.2b11] - 2026-02-22
### Added
- **proot-distro Optimization**: Added `--disable-software-rasterizer` and forced hardware acceleration flags for better performance in emulated Linux environments.
- **Persistent Pairing Retry**: Implemented an automated retry loop for phone pairing to handle resource load delays (400 errors).
### Fixed
- **State Transition Race Conditions**: Improved `DETECT_STATE` to prioritize phone inputs over stale QR canvases.

## [0.0.2b10] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- **PyPI Release Consistency**: Finalized version string synchronization across documentation, code, and distribution metadata to resolve installation ambiguities.
- **Rollback Parity**: Confirmed stable phone pairing logic is correctly packaged for both macOS and Linux environments.

## [0.0.2b9] - 2026-02-22
### Added
- **Linux Stability Optimization**: Implemented a modern Linux-based Chromium User Agent to prevent 400 "Failed to load resource" errors on VPS environments.
- **Enhanced Browser Launch Args**: Added `--disable-web-security` and site-isolation overrides in `browser_manager.py` for improved cross-origin resource loading on Linux.
### Fixed
- **Phone Pairing Trigger**: Resolved an issue where pairing code generation would fail or fallback to QR in certain network conditions.
- **Session Consistency**: Ensured the stable phone pairing method is preserved for high-fidelity authentication.

## [0.0.2b8] - 2026-02-22
### Added
- **PyPI Release (v0.0.2b8)**: Optimized core engine distribution for latest environment compatibility.
### Fixed
- **Bridge Reliability**: Fixed underlying bridge issues that were causing media downloaders (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) to fail.
- **Group Command Execution**: Resolved protocol mismatches affecting group participant management.
### Changed
- **Stability Restoration**: Reverted engine-level logic modifications to ensure 100% parity with the original bridge specifications.
- **Documentation Consistency**: Synchronized plugin metadata requirements to support enhanced help system parsing in the userbot wrapper.

## [0.0.2b7] - 2026-02-21
### Added
- **Bridge-to-Python Logging**: Introduced `Astra.log` in the browser bridge, enabling real-time JS runtime logs to be streamed directly to the Python terminal.
- **Enhanced History Fetching**: Implemented a 3-stage strategy (Local Cache -> msgFindQuery -> loadEarlierMsgs) for 100% reliable message retrieval, even after deep anchors.
- **Anchorless Fetching**: The `.fetch` and `.history` commands now support being called without a reply, defaulting to the latest 10 messages in the chat.
### Fixed
- **History Command Crash**: Resolved a `TypeError` when `.history` was called without a quoted message.
- **Bulk Delete Race Condition**: Fixed "Unexpected null or undefined" error in `bulkDeleteMessages` by ensuring Store job persistence.
- **Fetch Count Consistency**: Fixed a bug where `.fetch` with high limits (>10) would only return 10 messages from the local cache tail.
- **Command Directionality**: Corrected a mapping error where anchorless fetches defaulted to 'after', returning zero history.
- **Protocol Stability**: Internal bridge logs promoted to `INFO` level for better visibility into engine decisions.

## [0.0.2b6] - 2026-02-20
### Added
- **Monolithic Requirements:** Explicitly added support for `aiosqlite`, `motor`, `aiohttp`, `psutil`, and `yt-dlp` in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` to support the userbot wrapper directly.
### Fixed
- **Module Imports**: Cleaned up legacy `SystemHealth` and `MediaFilter` bugs causing nested module resolutions to fail.
- **Typing Syntax**: Added missing `Union` to `astra/client/methods/chat.py` resolving a `NameError` crash during media initialization.

## [0.0.2b5] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Force Fetching Support**: Added `force` parameter to `Client.fetch_messages` and bridge-level `fetchMessages` to bypass internal caches and retrieve fresh data directly from WhatsApp storage.
- **High-Level Media Methods**: Added `send_image`, `send_video`, `send_audio`, and `send_sticker` directly to `Client`.
- **Client.delete_message Shortcut**: Introduced a streamlined `delete_message` method in the `Client` class for easier moderation plugin development.
- **Centralized Plugin Imports**: Command modules can now use `from . import *` to access core framework and utility symbols from the package level.
- **Smart Sticker Handling**: `send_sticker` now supports both file paths and Base64 data strings.
- **Client Shortcuts**: Exposed media methods (`send_audio`, `download_media`, etc.) as first-class citizens on the `Client` instance.

### Fixed
- **Mention Parsing Resilience**: Fixed `TypeError` in `Message.from_payload` by ensuring `mentionedJidList` gracefully handles `null` or missing values.
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Restored `download_media` and patched `send_media` to support `reply_to`, fixing crashes in plugins like `sticker`, `spotify`, and `youtube`.
- **Bridge Argument Normalization**: Updated `Astra.fetchMessages` (JS) to robustly handle both positional and dictionary-based argument payloads.
- **Userbot Response Loops**: Refined `purge` and `smart_reply` logic to prevent message editing failures when the status message and command message are the same.
- **Stability**: Standardized codebase with professional headers and updated repository branding (`Astra-Userbot`).

## [0.0.1b4] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Rate-limit protection for edits**: Integrated a mandatory 0.5s stability delay in `Message.edit` and `ChatMethods.edit_message`. This helps prevent WhatsApp rate limits and race conditions when performing rapid-fire edits.

### Fixed
- **Attribute cleanup**: Standardized on `is_media` globally to eliminate sporadic `AttributeError` crashes related to legacy `has_media` property.
- **Quoted media extraction**: Refined the model to accurately detect quoted stickers and media even when received as skeletal payloads.

### Changed
- **Unthrottled deletions**: Intentionally kept deletion methods fast. Multi-message removal remains high-speed without artificial delays.
- **Documentation**: Updated the Sphinx guide to reflect framework-level timing management, reducing the need for manual sleeps in custom handlers.
